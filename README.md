# Crime-Project

This project was done in Fall 2019 by me for my Python class at my first university, Saint Joseph's University. The following criteria had to be met to complete the project:

1. Have the program read data from an Excel sheet.
2. Count and print the total number of crimes that occured in Philadelphia the previos year
3. Count and print how many of those crimes were thefts
4. Count and print how many crimes fell under "Other Assaults"
5. Count and print how many crimes occured between the hours of twelve a.m. and six a.m.
6. Print the crime with the most occurances

Note that there are two versions of the code include in this repositroy. I completed the project once but decided to rewrite it to make it look
 more efficient and organized.
 
When you run the program, it takes some time to calculate the data from the spreadsheet; there is no visual to show it is loading, but the results should print out
 after around 30 seconds.
